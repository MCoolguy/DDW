Write a class called `EvaluateFraction` that evaluates postfix notation implemented using **Deque** data structure. Postfix notation is a way of writing expressions without using parenthesis.

For example, to create a postfix notation `1 2 + 3 *`, we can call this method repetitively, e.g. `e.input('1'); e.input('2'); e.input('+'); e.input('3'); e.input('*')`.
